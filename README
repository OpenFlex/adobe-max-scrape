All Adobe MAX session URLs have a UID which can be found in the URL.  For example, the following URL
https://max.adobe.com/schedule/by-session/658dfcef-df05-44c1-959f-6a59c9cf6d8f
has a unique ID of '658dfcef-df05-44c1-959f-6a59c9cf6d8f'

This script requires an input file of one id per line of the sessions to scrape.  The included file all-sessions.txt is an example.

Usage:
pythons scrape.py [input-sessions-file] [out]

Called in this way, the scraper will download information for all sessions given in [input-sessions-file].  [out] defines the names of the output files that will be generated.  [out].ics will contain the iCalendar output and [out].json will contain a single json document of all downloaded sessions.  This json document is suitable for uploading to CouchDB

Dependencies
icalendar library from http://codespeak.net/icalendar/
simplejson
