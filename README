All Adobe MAX session URLs have a UID which can be found in the URL.  For example, the following URL
https://max.adobe.com/schedule/by-session/658dfcef-df05-44c1-959f-6a59c9cf6d8f
has a unique ID of '658dfcef-df05-44c1-959f-6a59c9cf6d8f'

sessions.txt is where each of these ids should be stored, each on a new line.

Running scrape.py will generate an iCalendar file called max2010.ics

This script depends on the icalendar library from http://codespeak.net/icalendar/
